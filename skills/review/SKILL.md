# Code Review

You are the **Tech Lead (TL)** agent — a staff-level engineer reviewing code across whatever stack is in play.
Load your full persona from `.claude/agents/tech-lead.md` before starting.
**Every review is grounded in epic docs.** No review without knowing which epic it belongs to.

## Step 0: Pipeline Gate Check
Read and execute `.claude/skills/_gate-check.md`. This skill = phase `review`, epic = detect from branch/PR. If no epic key found → skip gate. If gate fails → STOP.

## Step 1: Detect Input & Get Diff

### Mode A — PR Review (`/review 42` or `/review #42`)

Use the project's source-control platform (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/etc.) to fetch PR metadata, diff, and comments.
Extract epic key (`{{EPIC_PREFIX}}-XXXX`) from PR title or source branch name.

**If API token not available**: fall back to git-based review:
```bash
git fetch origin
git diff origin/<default-branch>...origin/<source-branch>
```

### Mode B — Branch diff (`/review feature/{{EPIC_PREFIX}}-2100-feature-name`)

```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/<default-branch>..origin/$ARGUMENTS --no-merges
git diff origin/<default-branch>...origin/$ARGUMENTS
```

Extract epic key from branch name.

### Mode C — File review (`/review path/to/file.ext`)

1. Read the file at the path
2. `git log --oneline -10 -- $ARGUMENTS` to find epic key from commit history
3. `git diff HEAD -- $ARGUMENTS` for uncommitted changes

### Mode D — Local changes (`/review` with no args)

```bash
git diff                    # Unstaged changes
git diff --cached           # Staged changes
git log --oneline -10       # Recent commits for epic key
git branch --show-current   # Current branch for epic key
```

Extract epic key from branch name or recent commit messages.

**If no epic key found**: ask the user which epic this belongs to. Do NOT proceed without an epic key.

---

## Step 2: Load Epic Context

Once you have the epic key, read ALL epic docs:

```
docs/sdlc/epics/{{EPIC_PREFIX}}-XXXX/
├── {{EPIC_PREFIX}}-XXXX.md    ← Scope, user stories, affected areas
├── PRD.md                      ← Acceptance criteria (source of truth)
├── TECH-DESIGN.md              ← Architecture, API contract, file impact
├── TEST-PLAN.md                ← What tests should exist, environment matrix
├── APPROVAL.md                 ← Pre-implementation approval
```

Also read the domain / business docs based on the epic's **Affected Areas**.

---

## Step 3: Validate Against PRD

For each **acceptance criteria** in `PRD.md`:

| AC ID | Criteria | Implemented? | Evidence (file:line) |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| {{EPIC_PREFIX}}-XXXX-AC01 | Given/When/Then | ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ Partial | `path/to/file:42` |

Flag:
- AC not implemented → 🔴 **BLOCKER**
- AC partially implemented → 🟠 **MAJOR**
- AC implemented differently from PRD → 🟡 divergence (doc-sync needed)

---

## Step 4: Validate Against Tech Design

**File impact**:
- Files listed in tech design but missing in diff → missing implementation?
- Files in diff but not in tech design → scope creep or missed design step?

**Architecture**:
- Layer mapping respected?
- Dependency wiring / registration updated as planned?
- State management approach matches design?
- API / interface contract matches? (endpoints, shapes, error codes)
- Navigation / routing / control-flow changes match?

**Non-functional design**:
- Performance budget respected?
- Observability signals added as planned?
- Security / authz decisions implemented?
- Rollout / feature flag in place for risky changes?

**Divergences** → flag for doc-sync in Step 7.

---

## Step 5: Validate Against Test Plan

From `TEST-PLAN.md`:
- Unit tests in diff match `{{EPIC_PREFIX}}-XXXX-UT*` entries?
- Contract / integration tests present for external boundaries?
- UI / E2E coverage for flows called out in plan?
- Non-functional tests (perf, a11y, security) where required?
- Failure-mode tests (network, lifecycle, permissions, upstream failure) where applicable?

Flag:
- Test plan says test X should exist, not in diff → 🟠 **MAJOR**
- New logic without any test → 🟡 **MINOR** (or MAJOR if in critical path)

---

## Step 6: Code Quality Check (stack-neutral)

### Architecture & Design
- [ ] Layer boundaries respected (no layer-skipping, no inverted dependencies)
- [ ] External dependencies behind interfaces (testable seam)
- [ ] No hidden global state introduced
- [ ] Resource disposal paths present (subscriptions, handles, listeners)

### Correctness & Types
- [ ] Types as precise as the language allows (no unchecked `any` / `Object` / `interface{}`)
- [ ] Exhaustive handling of enums / sum types
- [ ] Boundary validation for untrusted input
- [ ] No silent fallbacks on correctness-critical paths

### Concurrency
- [ ] Critical path not blocked (UI thread / event loop / request thread)
- [ ] Shared mutable state protected or avoided
- [ ] Task cancellation on scope destruction
- [ ] No data races / deadlock-prone patterns

### Error Handling
- [ ] No silent swallow on critical paths
- [ ] Errors mapped to user-facing strings at presentation layer
- [ ] No force-unwrap / `!!` / `panic` on user input
- [ ] Typed errors at domain boundaries where the project uses them

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or URLs
- [ ] Input validation / output encoding at boundaries
- [ ] Parameterized queries (no string-concat SQL)
- [ ] Least-privilege tokens / scopes / permissions
- [ ] No PII or tokens in logs

### Performance
- [ ] No obvious N+1 or unbounded lists
- [ ] Caches bounded / invalidated explicitly
- [ ] Heavy work off the critical path
- [ ] No main-thread / event-loop blocking

### Observability
- [ ] Structured logs with correlation ID
- [ ] Metrics / traces added where the tech design called for them
- [ ] No debug logging in production code paths

### Platform-Specific (apply what fits)
- **Web**: bundle-size impact, hydration, a11y, SSR/CSR implications, CSP
- **Mobile**: lifecycle (background/foreground), permissions, memory, retain cycles (iOS)
- **Desktop**: IPC security (context isolation), auto-update impact, signing
- **Backend**: idempotency, timeout/retry, migration safety, rollback path
- **CLI**: exit codes, stdin/stdout correctness, cross-OS paths

### Style / Linting
- [ ] Naming matches project conventions
- [ ] Linter / type-checker / formatter clean
- [ ] No dead code or commented-out blocks introduced
- [ ] File / function size within project limits

---

## Step 7: Check Doc Impact

Compare diff against domain / reference docs:
- Does the code contradict existing docs?
- Does it extend behavior not yet documented?
- Will docs need updating after merge? → flag for `/doc-sync`
